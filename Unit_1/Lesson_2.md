# Lesson 2: What is TDD?

## Test Driven Development Definition
A coding methodology where tests are written before code is written.

In terms of coffee makers: 
- Unit tests
    - Ensure individual components work on their own
    - e.g. Does the heater work? Does the tank hold water?
- Integration tests
    - Ensure a few components work together
    - e.g. Does the heater heat the water in the tank? 
- System (end to end) tests
    - Ensure everything works together
    - e.g. Does the machine make a cup of coffee
- Acceptance tests
    - After being launched, are customers satisfied with the resule?

 ## TDD Goals
 - Know when something breaks and where
 - Know that the whole system is working correctly

## Worflow Without TDD

1) Choose something to work on
1) Build it based on specifications
1) Test it with small scripts

## Worflow **With** TDD

1) Choose something to work on
1) Write tests that would pass if product works
1) Keep building until all tests pass

## **Results are the same** regardless of method - TDD forces you to **prioritze** tasks
